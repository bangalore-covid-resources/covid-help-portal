# Covid Help Portal

This is an initiative by a like minded volunteers to help the people affected by Covid.

People affected by Covid may need help like finding the Oxygen, Ambulance, Plasma, Medicines etc. Most of the sources while finding these details are not credible and an ample amount of time is wasted before getting the right help. The time wasted in this process may lead to critical situation.

This portal aims at reducing this time by providing the details of the credible sources frequently verified by our team of volunteers.
